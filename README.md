## Hangman Game

**Hangman** is a traditional word-guessing game that challenges players to reveal a hidden word by guessing its letters one at a time.

### ðŸŽ® How It Works

- A secret word is selected.
- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct positions.
- If the guess is wrong, a part of the figure is drawn on a gallows.
- The game continues until:
  - The player correctly guesses the entire word, or
  - The stick figure is completely drawn (after 7 incorrect guesses).

### ðŸ§  Skills Involved

- Vocabulary
- Spelling
- Deductive reasoning

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Guess the word before the figure is fully "hanged."

Hangman is often played on paper, whiteboards, or digitally as an educational game, especially in language learning.
